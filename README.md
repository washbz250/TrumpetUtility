README
-----------
Trumpet Utility is an app designed to assist trumpet players and provide a basic reference to many needed things (scales, notes, etc.). TrumpetUtility is built using HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript, but it is meant to be compiled with Cordova and used on Android devices. The Holo Theme came from https://github.com/zmyaro/holo-web, so use that if you wish to use the Android theme in your HTML pages.
