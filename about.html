		<p>Trumpet Utility is being actively developed upon by Zach Washburn. This app is Open-source, and you may use my code as long as you include my name. If you wish to use the source, please email me as I do not have the source publicly available yet.</p>
		<b style="text-decoration: underline;">Developers</b>
		<br />
		<p>If you liked the theme I had, it didn't originate from me. The original GitHub link is <a href="https://github.com/zmyaro/holo-web">Here</a> This app was developed in HTML5 via Apache Cordova, using Adobe PhoneGap Build.</p>

		<b style="text-decoration: underline;">Support</b>
		<p>If you have a problem with the app, please don't hesitate to contact <a href="mailto:admin@washbz250.x10.mx?Subject=Support%20Email" target="_top">
		admin@washbz250.x10.mx</a>. You will usually receive a response within the day. If you email on a weekday, please expect an email at around 5-6 PM. If you email on a weekend, you can expect an email soon after you send it.</p>
		<b style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose</b>
		<br />
		<p>This app was developed by a trumpet player for trumpet players. This app was created mainly due to the lack of free/open source trumpet reference type apps on the app stores.</p>
        <b style="text-decoration: underline">Future Additions/Suggestions</b>
        <br />
        <p>If you have any suggestions or requests for future additions, please email the developer at admin@washbz250.x10.mx.
